    <h2>Early Childhood</h2>
    <p class="para">Hunter Newton was born in Lancaster, South Carolina. His parents are Mark and Kaye Newton, a younger brother of Jeremy Newton. Hunter was all about art, you'd always find him drawing, painting or making something out of paper. Even if you saw him outside playing, chances are that he's drawing in the dirt with a stick. Other than art, he loved being outside, riding bikes, climbing trees and playing with his cousins. </p>
